# *PyBer Analysis*

## *Overview of the Project*

*We are trying to help the decision-makers at PyBer and We have to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city data type. We creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.*

*The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities.*

### *Resources*

*PyBer_ride_data.csv, city_data.csv, ride_data.csv*

*Python, Panda, Matplotlib library, Jupyter Notebook*

## *Analysis*

*The following is the summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.*

## *Summary*

* *PyBer ridesharing is more popular in urban cities.*
* *PyBer drivers are more in urban cities than rural cities.*
* *PyBer's revenue is mostly from in urban cities.*
* *PyBerâ€™s average fare per ride is more in rural cities.*
* *Average fare per driver is more in rural cities.*
* *As there is a big difference in the Average Fare Per Driver & Average fare per ride of three city types, there is a need for further analyzing the factors affecting the fares. Travel distance could be an important factor.*
